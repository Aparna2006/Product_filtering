# Product_filtering
Product Filtering is a feature commonly used on e-commerce websites üõí that allows users to narrow down and refine the displayed products based on specific criteria üîç. This makes it easier for users to find products that meet their needs and preferences ‚ù§Ô∏è without having to scroll through a long list of items ‚¨áÔ∏è.

## Features
- **Category-based Filtering**: Users can filter products by categories such as "Pizza", "Cake", and "Ice Cream" by clicking the corresponding buttons.
- **Search-based Filtering**: Users can type in the search box to filter products based on a keyword (e.g., "cake", "pizza").
- **Interactive Buttons**: Highlight the selected filter button to show which category or filter is currently active.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adjusts for different screen sizes to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
